# wordle_x Rules & Skills

This file defines the template structure for local workspace rules and skills.

## 🚀 Post-Change Verification Protocol
You **MUST** run the project verification command after every code change to guarantee stability and prevent regressions.

### Rebuild and Verify Command
Run the following command from the workspace root:
```bash
docker-compose config
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. Never skip verification before committing. The verification step **MUST** execute all unit and integration test suites.
> 2. You **MUST** update the [status.md](file:///./status.md) file after each task to reflect the current status of features, completed tasks, and architectural changes.
> 3. You **MUST** generate a git commit with an accurate, descriptive commit message representing the changes after every successful execution (only if a Git repository is initialized in the workspace; skip this step if Git is not initialized).

## 🧪 Automated Testing & Bug Prevention
To ensure that projects are robust enough to share with others, you must establish and maintain strict testing habits:

1. **Test Coverage**: Write automated unit and/or integration tests for all new features, API endpoints, and core business logic.
2. **Bug Fix Verification**: When fixing a bug, write a test case that reproduces the bug, verify that it fails, and then verify that it passes after the fix is implemented.
3. **Robust Input Validation**: Ensure tests check boundary conditions, invalid inputs, error handling paths, and API constraints to catch bugs before they reach runtime.
4. **Zero-Failure Tolerance**: All automated tests must pass successfully before a task is considered complete.
5. **Dynamic View & API Route Sanity Checking**: Implement and maintain a dynamic route scanner test that loops through all registered HTML and API endpoints to verify that GET requests do not trigger compile or `500 Internal Server Errors`. For API paths, ensure they return valid JSON structures and appropriate status codes, providing instant compile coverage for the entire routing tree.
6. **Fail-on-Unexpected-Errors**: Configure the test runner or assertions to capture log outputs. Any unexpected `ERROR` or `CRITICAL` logs written during a test execution must fail the test run, transforming silent, swallowed exceptions into loud, test-failing assertions.
7. **Shared Mock Fixtures**: Centralize mock payloads and external API responses (e.g. TMDB, Plex) into a shared test fixtures folder. Test suites must reuse these mock utilities and decorators instead of writing repetitive inline mocks, saving token quota and maintaining mock consistency.

## 💎 Code Quality & Production Standards

### 1. Setup & Portability (Zero-Config & Onboarding)
*   **Zero-Config Onboarding & .env Bootstrapping**: If a local `.env` configuration file is missing on startup or initialization, the agent must automatically copy `.env.example` to `.env`, generate secure random secret keys for session/cryptographic signatures (replacing placeholders), and configure default local ports/credentials so the stack can run out-of-the-box.
*   **Zero-Config & Repeatable Setup (Database Seeding)**: Every database schema migration must be accompanied by a database seeding script or startup check that automatically populates default configuration settings and initial/dummy data, so the application runs immediately in 1-click on a new machine.
*   **Single-Source-of-Truth Onboarding (README)**: Every workspace must maintain a clean, single-page `README.md` file at the root containing:
    1. A one-sentence description of the application.
    2. The exact quick-start command (e.g., `docker compose up` or `npm run dev`).
    3. The local port/URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
    4. Default developer/admin credentials (if any).
*   **Environment Configurations & Secrets Safety**: 
    - When introducing new variables to `.env`, immediately document them in `.env.example` with placeholders or dummy values to prevent configuration drift.
    - Never write raw secrets, private keys, database passwords, or active API credentials into any code file, even temporarily for local testing. All credentials must be loaded dynamically from environment variables, and testing environments must rely exclusively on mocked values or dummy tokens to prevent accidental git commits of sensitive data.
*   **Dependency Reconciliation & Lockfile Consistency**: Whenever package manifests (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`) are modified, the corresponding installer/rebuild command must be executed immediately to synchronize the active developer and container environment. Lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`, etc.) must always be generated and committed to preserve exact dependency versions.
*   **Startup Config Validation**: On application startup, a configuration validation check must verify all required environment variables. If any are missing or malformed, log a clear error and terminate the startup process immediately.
*   **Database Backups & Recovery**: Every database setup must include an automated backup script (e.g., daily cron) that dumps the database to a compressed, timestamped file. A documented `restore` command must exist in the README.
*   **Offline Development Mode (Mocking APIs)**: Introduce an optional `MOCK_MODE=true` toggle in `.env`. When enabled, bypass actual external API calls and return locally stored realistic JSON payloads to allow offline workspace development and testing.

### 2. Architecture & Feature Scoping
*   **Upfront Plan Alignment & Ambiguity Resolution**:
    - For any non-trivial tasks (e.g., changes affecting database schemas, API routes, or multi-component UI states), draft an `implementation_plan.md` first. Recommend the `/grill-me` command to the user to run an interactive interview to align on design decisions, color choices, and logical constraints before writing code. This saves time, limits refactoring, and conserves token quota.
    - When a new feature is introduced, or if task requirements are underspecified or ambiguous, the agent **must** halt and ask additional prompting/clarifying questions to thoroughly understand the desired end state rather than starting execution and assuming something incorrectly.
    - If codebase context reveals conflicting patterns of doing the same thing, halt and present the choice of patterns to the user with pros/cons instead of choosing one arbitrarily.
    - For complex logic, endpoints, or data models, propose the function/API signatures, schemas, or interface designs to the user first. Once approved, proceed to full implementation.
    - Reference the active document and cursor position provided in metadata if relevant; if they seem related but ambiguous, ask for confirmation.
*   **Framework & Architecture Decisions**: When introducing new frameworks, major dependencies, or architectural shifts, present 2-3 viable options detailing the pros, cons, and trade-offs of each, and wait for user approval before executing.
*   **Separation of Infrastructure and Application Settings**: Keep a clear separation between infrastructure settings and application preferences. Settings required to run the application process and container (such as database URLs, ports, volume mounts, and path locations) must live in `.env` or system environment configurations. Conversely, application-level configurations and feature toggles (such as UI preferences, AI model configurations, and functional toggles) must live within the application's settings dashboard/database rather than environment files.
*   **Modular Architecture & Code Separation**: Avoid monolithic files. Keep files modular by separating logic into distinct files and sub-modules. Limit file sizes (ideally under 500 lines) and function/method complexity. Extend base objects or classes by importing them locally and building extensions in separate files rather than piling all behavior into a single base definition file.
*   **Database Relationships & Indexing**: Every database foreign key column must have a database index defined. All database relationships must explicitly define their deletion behavior (such as `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON DELETE SET NULL`) to prevent slow query performance and orphaned data.
*   **Asynchronous Workflows & Dynamic UI Updates**:
    - **Heavy Task Offloading**: Keep the HTTP request-response cycle under 500ms. Offload heavy processing (e.g., file generation, email dispatch, slow external API queries) to background queues/workers, immediately returning a `202 Accepted` status and a `task_id` to the client.
    - **Dynamic, Refresh-Free UI**: The user interface must update dynamically and fluidly without forcing a full page refresh. When background tasks are running, the UI must monitor the task state (via polling, WebSockets, or Server-Sent Events) and update the interface dynamically.
    - **Active Loading Indicators**: A clear visual loading indicator (e.g., skeletons, progress bars, or spinners) must always be present when backend tasks or network requests are active. If the progress of a background task can be quantified, a percentage-based progress bar must be displayed.
    - **Idempotency & Retry Resilience**: Background jobs must be designed as idempotent (multiple identical requests yield the same outcome). Workers must implement automatic retries with exponential backoff and a maximum retry threshold (e.g., max 3 retries) to handle network hiccups.
    - **Task Timeout & Resource Management**: Configure strict timeouts for all background jobs to prevent worker process hangs and resource exhaustion.
*   **Soft Deletes with Retention Windows**: Avoid hard deleting critical user data immediately on request. Flag records with a `deleted_at` timestamp and retain them for a recovery window (e.g., 30 days) to allow restoration before background tasks permanently prune them. Provide users a clear option to override the queue and immediately hard-delete items to free up storage space.

### 3. Code Quality & Structure
*   **Imports**: Write all imports at the top of the file. No lazy imports inside functions or methods unless absolutely required for dynamic loading or avoiding circular dependencies (documented with clear comments). Order imports logically (standard library, third-party libraries, local imports).
*   **Types & Schemas**: Add type hints to all Python function signatures, variables, and return values (or use language-appropriate typing standards). Use standard data schemas (e.g. Pydantic models in Python, TypeScript interfaces in TS) for API payloads and database records.
*   **No Code Stubs**: Never write code stubs, temporary `TODO` comments, or truncated snippets (e.g., `// ... rest of code remains the same`). Code edits must always be fully complete and ready to run.
*   **Living Rules Document (AGENTS.md)**: Proactively update the project's `AGENTS.md` rules file whenever repository-specific findings, quirks, or hidden behaviors are discovered during tasks. Treating `AGENTS.md` as a living documentation file ensures subsequent agent sessions build upon shared repository context without losing history.
*   **Multi-LLM Rules Synchronization (Multi-Format Rules)**: To ensure that project rules, verification commands, and quality standards are respected by different LLM assistants (such as Gemini, Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf), always mirror and synchronize these project rules across the formats expected by each platform (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`). Whenever you update the project's rules or discover repository-specific behavior, make sure to propagate those changes to all of these formats to maintain alignment.
*   **Automatic Workspace Rules Synchronization**: At the start of every session, check if the local rules files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`) exist and match the latest global template `C:\Users\caste\.gemini\project.md`. If they are out of sync, outdated, or missing, immediately perform a synchronization cycle to update them, ensuring that the latest global standards are consistently applied across all projects without manual user intervention.

### 4. UI/UX & Aesthetics
*   **Aesthetics & UI Standards**: Maintain a premium visual design: consistent typography, harmonious color palettes, smooth transitions, proper margins, and descriptive spacing. Do not use inline styles or raw CSS files unless explicitly requested. Always utilize the established local utility framework (like Tailwind CSS) and existing UI primitives. Ensure the GUI is fully responsive and optimized for mobile viewports (supporting touch-friendly targets, collapsible navigation, adaptive grid counts, and screen-fitting wrappers). Do not focus exclusively on desktop layouts; verify responsiveness on multiple screen sizes.
*   **Single Page App (SPA) UX Behavior & Dynamic Rendering**: Ensure all user interface applications are designed to dynamically render changes, page content, and state transitions without forcing a full page refresh. Maintain standard multi-page and deep-linking capabilities by combining technologies like HTMX, Alpine.js, or custom JavaScript pushState/history API controls. Navigation and dynamic layout shifts must preserve clean browser histories and distinct shareable URLs, delivering a fluid, single-page app feel while retaining searchability and page structures.
*   **AI Integrations & Settings Fluidity**:
    - All AI-powered integrations and features must be fully toggleable (on/off).
    - When AI integration is enabled, the interface must provide controls to enable/disable AI thinking/reasoning and select the thinking effort level (e.g., low, medium, high).
    - To maintain a clean and fluid user experience, dynamically hide any dependent or related setting inputs when the parent AI integration or thinking toggle is turned off, rather than showing them as disabled or greyed out.
    - All core features must function completely with or without AI integrations. If a core capability cannot be accomplished without AI, it cannot be considered a core feature; AI must only serve as an optional enhancement to existing core workflows rather than a hard requirement.
*   **Button Double-Submit & Loading States**: Every write request (POST, PUT, DELETE) button must enter a loading state (e.g., show a spinner) and be disabled immediately upon click to prevent duplicate submissions.
*   **Search Input Debouncing**: All text search inputs triggering backend queries must be debounced by 200ms–300ms to prevent overwhelming the server with keypress queries.
*   **Image & Asset Optimization**: All user-uploaded images must be compressed, resized, and converted to modern formats (e.g., WebP or AVIF) on the server before storage. Use SVGs for static icons.
*   **Optimistic UI Updates**: Update the interface immediately upon user write requests (e.g., deletion, toggling status) before the server completes validation. In case of API failure, revert the state on the screen and show an error banner.
*   **Eliminating Theme Flash**: Ensure user-preferred themes (dark/light) are rendered instantly without a flash of default styling by checking preferences in blocking inline head scripts or via server-side rendering.
*   **Dynamic Theming Engine**: Support run-time application theme adjustments by anchoring primary and accent utility styles to CSS HSL color variables instead of hardcoded hex values.
*   **Keyboard Accessibility & Focus States**: Guarantee full keyboard accessibility (`Tab` traversal) with highly visible focus rings on interactive components, and support universal command palettes (`Cmd+K`) and shortcuts.

### 5. Reliability, Security & Error Handling
*   **Error Handling & Logging**:
    - Do not use broad `except Exception:` blocks without logging or re-raising.
    - Use built-in logging libraries instead of raw print/console statements in production code.
    - Ensure all logs are human-readable, clear, and structured. Avoid random or cryptic words (e.g. "windy-blue-sunday-morning"). Messages should follow a simple, descriptive pattern like: `[Job/Operation] - [Category/Level] - [Detail Message]` (e.g., `Scanning - Error - Could not access directory for scanning`).
    - **Visual Error Boundaries**: All user interfaces must implement explicit error boundaries, alerts, or notification banners. Never allow backend failures (such as database disconnects or API timeouts) to fail silently or freeze the UI with infinite loading animations. The application must display a clear, helpful message telling the user what failed and how to troubleshoot it.
*   **Workspace Health Diagnostics (Doctor)**: Maintain a workspace diagnostic script (`doctor.py` or similar) that validates database migrations, checks local network loops, tests external integration endpoints, and verifies service reachability. Run this script first when troubleshooting stack issues to isolate configuration/network drift from code bugs.
*   **Zero-Downtime Migration Safety**: Database schema modifications must be backward-compatible. Any new column must be nullable or have a safe default value. Destructive database changes (such as dropping columns or tables) must be handled in two phases: first decouple the application code from the schema element, and only drop the element in a separate subsequent deployment once the code is fully clean.
*   **Self-Healing Connections & Startup Diagnostics**: Applications must implement pre-flight connection checks on startup to verify that the database and critical third-party APIs are reachable. If a connection is unavailable, the application must log structured diagnostic warnings (e.g., `[Startup] - [Database] - [Connection failed, retrying in 5s]`) and retry using exponential backoff, rather than hanging or crashing immediately.
*   **Object-Level Access Control**: Every resource request (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.) must perform object-level authorization by verifying that the currently authenticated session owns or is authorized to access the specific database ID requested, rather than blindly trusting user-supplied resource IDs.
*   **Strict Input Parameterization**: All database interactions must use parameterized queries or prepared statements via ORMs to separate code from inputs. Never use raw string concatenation for SQL statements or shell command arguments.
*   **Graceful API Degradation**: The failure of a third-party API must never crash the application or prevent other page elements from loading. Implement timeouts, catch exceptions, and show fallback/placeholder states.
*   **Traceable Error Codes & Correlation IDs**: Generate unique correlation IDs for incoming server requests. Log these IDs alongside tracebacks and display them on frontend error states to allow rapid trace tracking in log systems.

### 6. Infrastructure & Tech Preferences
*   **Coolify Deployments & Production Volume Mounts**: When deploying to Coolify or similar containerized orchestration platforms, keep all local development volume mounts (such as mounting the source code `- .:/app`) exclusively in `docker-compose.override.yml`. The main `docker-compose.yml` file must never contain runtime volume mounts that map local host files into the container. Under Coolify, the host repository's file structure is not mounted automatically; hence a volume mount in `docker-compose.yml` will overwrite the container's baked-in code with stale, empty, or missing directories from the host, causing silent or diagnostic-less deployment failures.
*   **CSRF & SSL Termination behind Reverse Proxies**: When applications are deployed behind reverse proxies (like Coolify's default Traefik router or Nginx reverse proxies), CSRF origin verification can fail if the proxy terminates SSL and forwards requests to the application server over HTTP (causing an HTTPS/HTTP origin scheme mismatch). Always ensure:
    - `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` is parameterized via environment variables and includes both `http://` and `https://` schemas for the production domain.
    - A custom CSRF middleware or setting (like matching the request host header against the origin hostname) is configured to handle reverse-proxy setups correctly without exposing the app to security vulnerabilities.
*   **CSRF & Secure Cookie Flags behind Reverse Proxies**: When running behind a reverse proxy terminating SSL, CSRF validation and secure session flags (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`) must remain active. Configure application middleware to trust proxy headers (like `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host`) and verify that production domain schemas are listed in trusted origins to prevent session hijacking.
*   **Maintain Git Exclusion Policies (.gitignore)**: Actively maintain the `.gitignore` file to ensure that local database files (e.g. `db.sqlite3` or local data directories), local logs, runtime caches, and sensitive environment config files (like `.env`) are strictly excluded from the repository. Review `.gitignore` whenever introducing new persistent files, logs directories, or local configuration files to prevent untracked local state or secret keys from being committed.
*   **Consistent Deployment of Fixes & Repeatable Setup**: Ensure that all fixes, database initialization tasks, custom commands, or setup migrations are programmatically encoded into startup or configuration files (such as `entrypoint.sh`, `docker-compose.yml`, or migration modules). Never rely on manual runtime CLI execution to maintain the application. This ensures a consistent and reproducible experience across development, staging, and production instances.
*   **Conventional Commits**: Write git commit messages using the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`) with descriptive subject lines under 50 characters.
*   **Docker Execution Security**: All Docker configurations must run the application process as a non-privileged user (never run as `root`) using the `USER` directive in the Dockerfile.
*   **Graceful Process Shutdown**: Configure signal handlers (`SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`) to allow processes and database transactions to drain running cycles cleanly before container shutdown.

## 💡 Token & Quota Conservation & Development Experience Rules
To maintain high speed, prevent burning through API limits, and ensure a robust DX:

1. **Diff-Only Modifications**:
   - Never overwrite a whole code file to make small edits. Always use targeted replacements (`replace_file_content` or `multi_replace_file_content` on specific line ranges) to minimize token transfer.
2. **Token-Conservative Discovery (Grep-First)**:
   - Always use targeted `grep_search` to find relevant lines and files first. When calling `view_file`, specify precise `StartLine` and `EndLine` ranges rather than reading full multi-hundred line files, unless the overall file context is absolutely necessary.
   - Inspect local package manifests or lockfiles to verify exact dependency versions before recommending or writing code that relies on specific APIs.
3. **Execution Guardrails & Test Sandboxing**:
   - Run the project verification or test suite once before making any edits. This ensures you do not waste time and tokens debugging pre-existing test failures under the assumption that your new code caused them.
4. **No Speculative Code/Stubs**:
   - Never write speculative helper methods or add features that aren't requested just because "they might be useful later." Keep the code footprint and token consumption minimal.
