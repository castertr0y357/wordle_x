<analysis>
The user requested the development of a Wordle-style web game. The core requirements included a dynamic word length (5-8 letters), a clean UI, and full client-side game logic. The initial version was successfully built. Subsequent user requests involved widening the game board to prevent scrolling, implementing input validation (for word length and existence in a dictionary), and preventing duplicate guesses.

The development process was iterative, but encountered recurring issues with the word validation logic. After implementing duplicate guess prevention, a regression bug was introduced, causing all valid words to be rejected. The most recent action was an attempt to fix this validation bug by modifying  and . The immediate context is that a fix has been deployed, but it has not yet been verified by testing. The trajectory shows a pattern of implementing a feature, which then breaks a previous one, requiring a debugging cycle.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to create a fully functional, frontend-only prototype of a Wordle-style web game.

**Core Features:**
- **Dynamic Word Length:** Each new game randomly selects a word length between 5 and 8 letters.
- **Adaptive UI:** The game grid and keyboard must adjust to the current word length.
- **Complete Game Logic:** Includes submitting guesses, providing colored feedback (correct, present, absent), tracking remaining attempts, and handling win/loss conditions.
- **Input Validation:**
    - Guesses must be valid words found in a predefined list.
    - Guesses must match the length of the secret word.
    - Invalid guesses should not consume a turn.
- **No Duplicate Guesses:** A user cannot submit the same word more than once in a single game.
- **Polished UI:** The interface should be clean, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing, with no layout issues like scrollbars on the main game board.

The application is built entirely on the frontend using React, with game logic and word lists managed in JavaScript, requiring no backend communication.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Framework:** React.js
- **State Management:** React Hooks (, , ) for managing game state (e.g., solution, guesses, current turn).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a design-system-first approach, using HSL custom properties in .
- **UI Components:**  components are used for the base UI elements.
- **Game Logic:** All logic is client-side, using local JavaScript arrays for word lists and validation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard React project structure. All source code is located within the  directory.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The root component of the application. It initializes the game by selecting a word and renders the main .
    -   **Changes:** Recently modified alongside  to address a critical validation bug.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is a critical file containing the core game logic. It stores the word lists for different lengths and exports the  function, which is responsible for validating user guesses.
    -   **Changes:** This file has been the primary source of bugs. It was recently rewritten to fix a regression where all word submissions were being incorrectly marked as invalid. The  function was the focus of the fix.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Manages the entire state of a single game session, including the solution, all guesses, current turn, and keyboard letter states. It orchestrates the interactions between the grid, keyboard, and validation logic.
    -   **Changes:** Logic was added here to check for and prevent duplicate guesses from being submitted.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Renders a single row in the game grid.
    -   **Changes:** Was modified to increase the width of the grid, fixing a layout issue where 8-letter words caused a horizontal scrollbar.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Defines the application's design system, including all color tokens (in HSL format), fonts, and other base styles, which are consumed by Tailwind CSS. It is the foundation of the UI.
    -   **Changes:** Created during the initial build and has been stable since.

- There are no outstanding feature requests from the user. All tasks have been focused on implementing the initial requirements and fixing subsequent bugs.

<current_work>
The most recent task was to fix a critical regression bug. After implementing a feature to prevent duplicate guesses, the word validation logic broke, causing the game to reject all submitted words as invalid. The user reported, All words are considered invalid now again.

In response, the AI engineer performed a debugging session, identified the problem within the  function, and deployed a fix. This involved writing changes to two files:

1.  **/app/frontend/src/lib/words.js**: The core validation logic was corrected to properly check a submitted word against the appropriate word list.
2.  **/app/frontend/src/App.jsx**: This file was also modified, likely to ensure the corrected validation logic was properly integrated or to fix a related state management issue that contributed to the bug.

The files were written successfully, but the fix has not been tested or verified yet. The immediate work is therefore concluded, but the resolution of the bug is unconfirmed.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Run tests to verify that the latest fix has resolved the validation bug without reintroducing any other issues. Confirm that valid words are accepted and duplicate guesses are correctly rejected.
